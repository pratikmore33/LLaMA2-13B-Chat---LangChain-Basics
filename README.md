## LLaMA2-13B-Chat---LangChain-Basics

This repository contains notebooks that explain fundamental concepts of using prompts with the LLM (Large Language Model) and the tasks performed by LLM.

1. **Loading LLaMA-2-13B Model in Google Colab:**
   - Loading the LLaMA-2-13B model in the free version of Google Colab using libraries like BitsAndBytes, Accelerate, Transformers, and Einops.
   - BitsAndBytes is used to quantize model size and weights with specific configurations, including double quantization and 'nf4' quantization type, while optimizing memory and computational precision with 'bfloat16' data type for running large models on GPU.

2. **Using LLaMA Model with LangChain:**
   - Leveraging the LLaMA model with LangChain requires using the `pipeline` function from Transformers, where the model and tokenizer are specified along with configuration options.
   - Notable options include setting `torch_dtype` to 'bfloat16', 'device_map' to 'auto', and specifying token generation parameters.

3. **LangChain for Prompt and Chain Function:**
   - Utilizing LangChain for prompt generation and chaining of tasks.
   - Creating a system prompt and an instruction to convert text from English to French.
   - Using templates and variables to facilitate text generation and task chaining.

4. **Summarization Task:**
   - Demonstrating the use of LLM and LangChain for summarization tasks.

5. **Simple Chatbot:**
   - Implementing a basic chatbot using LangChain.

6. **Prompt Generation Explained:**
   - Explaining prompt generation techniques and strategies in the notebook.

### Additional Explanations:

- The use of 'bfloat16' data type optimizes the model for deep learning tasks, achieving a balance between memory efficiency and computational precision.
- The 'bitsandbytes' library is used to quantize the model, making it suitable for running on a free Google Colab GPU.
- The LangChain approach allows for a flexible and efficient way to chain and execute NLP tasks using LLMs.
- Detailed code examples and explanations can be found in the notebook within this repository.
- Please check the notebook for more in-depth code examples, prompt generation explanations, and chatbot implementation details.
